 rome_je_main: "A Dream Called Rome"
 rome_je_main_reason: "Republicans at the gates of Saint Peter's Basilica! The papacy clings to power as the republicans grow in strength. Whether it is redemption or oblivion that awaits her, Rome balances on a knife edge."

 je_restore_emperor_reason: "Rome reached its peak under the guide of a strong ruler, thus is mandatory for our nation to be ruled by an Emperor if we want to really become the dominant power of the Mediterranean"

 je_mare_nostrum: "Mare Nostrum"
 je_mare_nostrum_reason: "Before the Emperor the general idea of the ruling class was to reclaim Italy, but for the Emperor such an insignificant feat would be an insult to the name of Rome. It's time to take back Our Sea."

 je_church_ita: "Imperial Church of Italia"
 je_church_ita_reason: "Recent history has taught us that even if the Pope is the highest religious authority of the catholic world, we are far from safe.\nIt's time to expand our borders to make sure the papal authority will never be questioned again."

 je_sax_main: "The Future of our Kingdom"
 je_sax_main_reason: "Following the Carolingian Empire's downfall, our kingdom has been greatly diminished.\nNow a mere shadow of its legendary glory, the long-complacent government falls behind the changing currents of the industrial world.\nCan theocratic rule, having weathered more than a thousand years of storms, withstand the tide? Or will our a thousand years old kingdom fall, like so many others, into the frothing sea?"

 je_gods_chosen_people: "God's Chosen People"
 je_gods_chosen_people_reason: "Now that the government and the clergy have understood the true meaning of our Mission, it's time to lay the first stone."

 je_a_kingdom_for_ngp: "A Kingdom for the North Germans"
 je_a_kingdom_for_ngp_reason: "In order to become the Kingdom of Germania, we must first reclaim all its de jure lands.\nDiscontent is groving in the capital, so if we don't want the republicans to rise to power before us, we must keep the turmoil in Dresden as low as possible."

 je_charlemagne_legacy: "Charlemagne`s Legacy"
 je_charlemagne_legacy_reason: "Restoring the Carolingian Empire has been a dream for many people, and if we want to achieve this dream we will need to get rid of the Theocracy, and expand our borders quickly to show our People that this is not an impossible feat.\nBeware of the republicans, if we can't manage to keep the turmoil in Dresden low they might cause a revolt."

 je_restore_the_ce: "Restore the Carolingian Empire"
 je_restore_the_ce_reason: "With the return of Thuringia to the international stage, and the military stronger than it has ever been, the refoundation of the Carolingian empire could become a reality if we keep staying in the right hands."

 je_ngf_pum_reason: "The time has come to unite all north german people"

 je_bav_pro: "The Matter of Bavaria"
 je_bav_pro_reason: "Reclaiming the Kingdom of Bavaria would grant us more resources and more wealth, but the deep cultural and religious differences between the Czech and the South German people could cause many problems for the stability of the reign, making Bavaria more of a burden than a gain."

 je_lom_main: "Winds of Change"
 je_lom_main_reason: "The Lombard League is a de facto federation of three republics, the Milanese Republic, the Republic of Piedmont and the Merchantile republic of Genoa.\nThis great decentralization of power has favored the personal interests of most politicians, to the disadvantage of the people of the confederation.\nThis situation cannot continue, and the ruling class knows that.\nPeople demand change."

 je_lom_ita: "A Nation for the Italian People"
 je_lom_ita_reason: "Centuries of division have greatly fractured the cultures in the italian peninsula, but the feeling of being italian has cemented in the hearts of italian people\nParochialism and personal interests have hindered any type of national unification, but now things have changed.\nIt is now time to unite all italian people under one flag."

je_lom_rome: "La Questione Romana"
je_lom_rome_reason: "Even though centuries of division have split italian and roman people apart culturally, Rome is still the city that represent the peninsula the most, and thus italian politicians are heavily pushing to conquer it."

je_venice_main: "Hub of all Trades"
je_venice_main_reason: "With the spreading of industrialization all across Europe and the increasing necessity of raw resources, our once glorious merchantile republic has the opportunity to become the most significant port of Europe, but in order to achieve that we must monopolize most of the trade routes that come into Europe."
je_venice_main_goal: "7 Journal Entries have been completed."
je_venice_main_r: "Hegemon of the Trade"
je_venice_main_r_reason: "Now that we have gained the status of hegemon of the trade, we must do everything in our power to defend it, or we will lose everything we fought for."

je_venice_adriatic: "Queen of the Adriatic"
je_venice_adriatic_reason: "Reclaiming our former lands in Dalmatia and Albania will help us secure all trades routes coming from and going and to Venice"

je_venice_resources: "Raw Resources Crisis"
je_venice_resources_reason: "The impending need to increase the industrialization level of our country has exacerbated one of the biggest problem of our country: the lack of natural raw resources.\nConquering the rich region of Lombardy, albeit an hard task, would give us some room to breathe for the time being."

je_venice_black: "The Gatekeeper of the Black Sea"
je_venice_black_reason: "Taking control of the Bosphorus would give us the complete monopoly on naval trade from the black sea."
je_venice_black_r: "Protect the Bosphorus"
je_venice_black_r_reason: "If we lose the Bosphorus, we will lose power, money and authority, therefore it's mandatory to defend it to the last man."

je_venice_cape: "World's Restocking Port"
je_venice_cape_reason: "Until another way to reach the east is found, every european ship going to and coming from the east has to restock in Cape Colony;\nTaking that region would grant us wealth, as well as political power and influence."
je_venice_cape_r: "Protect Cape Town"
je_venice_cape_r_reason: "Owning the Cape is source of international prestige, as well as money, thus losing this region would be a great loss."

je_venice_east: "Eastern Trade"
je_venice_east_reason: "The industrial revolution ha caused the rapid enrichment of some segments of society, and therefore the increase in need for luxury materials and goods that are only available in the east.\nHence it is mandatory to acquire trade ports in that region."

je_venice_mediterranean: "The Gates of the Mediterranean"
je_venice_mediterranean_reason: "Obtaining Gibraltar would give us the complete monopoly on the naval trade of the Mediterranean, and if we were to find another way to reach the east faster and monopolize that too, immense wealth and political influence would be gained."
je_venice_mediterranean_r: "Protect Gibraltar and the Suez"
je_venice_mediterranean_reason_r: "Gibraltar and the Suez are by far our greatest assets, hence the idea of losing even one of them is not to be contemplated."

je_venice_panama: "An Impossible Project"
je_venice_panama_reason: "Venetian architects have started fantasizing about a way to connect the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, and it seems like it would be possible to hypothetically build a canal in central america, but we would have to send a mission first and the project itself would be massively expensive;\nOn the other side, building such a canal would give us the monopoly of all the naval trade routes between those two Oceans."
je_venice_advance: "Completing this Journal Entry will make thr "Hub of all Trades" JE advance."
je_venice_panama_r: "Protect the Panama"
je_venice_panama_reason_r: "The Panama is Venice's Magnum Opus, and considering the absurd amount of money and time we spent for it, even the idea of losing it is inconceivable.\nThe Canal must not fall in other nation's hands."

je_rhineland_main: "A Confederation made of, by and for the Germanic People"
je_rhineland_main_reason: "Our neighbors still consider our nation to be unable to defend itself, but time has passed and things have changed.\nIf we were to conquer the german lands next to us, not only we would get the recognition we deserve, but we could also sway the german nobility and form a greater confederation, which would allow us to become a force to reckon with."

je_boh_mor: "The Kingdom of Great Moravia"
je_boh_mor_reason: "The Kingdom of Great Moravia was the first successful attempt to gather most of the west slavic people under one flag.\nUnfortunately, almost a thousand years have passed since its fall, and a lot has changed; the only way we can convince the slovak and sorb people to unite into one people, is by leveraging our common ancestry and giving freedom of religion."
je_boh_dan: "The Danubian Kingdom"
je_boh_dan_reason: "Years of lost wars and revolts have caused the fall of the kingdom, but our great ruler is won't repeat the same mistake of his predecessor;\nIf we can guarantee freedom of religion and ethnic tolerance, the longevity of the kingdom will be secured."
je_moravian_culture: "Czech, Slovak and Sorb people will become Moravian."
je_ethno_boh: "A Kingdom for the [GetCulture('moravian').GetName] People"
je_ethno_boh_reason: "In order to repopulate our lands with our people, we must make sure people of other cultures understand that they are not welcomed in our great nation."
je_disf_king: "A Dysfunctional Kingdom"
je_disf_king_reason: "If we want to fully integrate those lands, we must pass cultural and religious reforms that can guarantee the freedom of the south german people.\nFurthermore the regions of austria and styria, which are de jure part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, are still not under our rule; needless to say, but this is not tolerable."
je_carp: "Reaching the Carphatians"
je_carp_reason: "Our country is geographically defended by the Alps to the south, and by multiple rivers to the north and to the west;\nOur only weakspot is the eastern border, which unfortunately is mostly made by great plains.\nReaching the Carphatians would be not only a source of international prestige, but it would grant us an excellent natural defensive border to the east, thus making it easier to defend our country."

je_ari_rev: "Aristocratic Uprising"
je_ari_rev_reason: "The high nobility is taking advantage of the death of the former king of Bavaria, Ludwig I, to detach from the kingdom, but luckily most of the army has shown his loyalty to the king.\nIt is time to make them pay for their act of treason."

je_bav_nat: "Winds of Change"
je_bav_nat_reason: "Nationalism is on the rise in all german lands;\nThose movements are still really small, but they might spread and explode pretty soon."

je_sgf: "The South German Federation"
je_sgf_reason: "South german people can be found in Bohemia, Hungary, Slovenia and north Italy; the south german people has never been a united people, therefore gathering all of it under one nation can be quite an arduous task.\nMany wars will be needed, so we have to prepare our nation first."
je_ger_conf: "The German Confederation"
je_ger_conf_reason: "#V At the dawn of a new era, the time has come for all German souls, scattered like stars across the vast expanse, to rise in unison beneath a single, resplendent flag.#!"

je_rusf_main: "Political Turmoil"
je_rusf_main_reason: "The People of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] wants a change, and the country has become a powder-keg ready to explode at the first spark."

rusftext: "#V $POC$ does not exist#!"
je_rusf_two: "Towards Russia"
je_rusf_two_reason: "This is but the start of a great revolution in all of Russia;\nIn order to unite the Russian People, we must first get rid of the old feudal system that still infest the Russian lands, and replace it with a new republican system."
je_backward_c: "A Backward Country"
je_backward_c_reason: "Great investments and reforms will be needed to bring our nation on par with the other european powers."

je_mis_ind: "Industrial Espionage Mission"

je_mis_ind_goal: "The spies have completed their mission."
je_mis_mil: "Military Espionage Mission"
je_mis_mil_reason: "The spies have been sent, the estimated time for the mission is 13 months, plus the time necessary for them to return to our country."
je_mis_mil_goal: "The spies have found the military projects and have managed to bring them back."

je_ural_rep: "Supporting Republican Movements in Ural"
je_ural_rep_reason: "If we directly attack the lords in the east we might risk having them unite to fight us, but if we were to ignite a revolution in every single region, those lords wouldn't be able to do anything to counter us."
je_ural_rep_goal: "The revolution is ready"

je_tobolsk_rep: "Supporting Republican Movements in Tobolsk"
je_tobolsk_rep_reason: "If we directly attack the lords in the east we might risk having them unite to fight us, but if we were to ignite a revolution in every single region, those lords wouldn't be able to do anything to counter us."
je_tobolsk_rep_goal: "The revolution is ready"

je_tomsk_rep: "Supporting Republican Movements in Tomsk"
je_tomsk_rep_reason: "If we directly attack the lords in the east we might risk having them unite to fight us, but if we were to ignite a revolution in every single region, those lords wouldn't be able to do anything to counter us."
je_tomsk_rep_goal: "The revolution is ready"

je_irk_rep: "Supporting Republican Movements in Krasnoyarsk"
je_irk_rep_reason: "If we directly attack the lords in the east we might risk having them unite to fight us, but if we were to ignite a revolution in every single region, those lords wouldn't be able to do anything to counter us."
je_irk_rep_goal: "The revolution is ready"

je_buy_salas: "Nimíipuu, Ídaahę́ and Pannakwati's Acquisition"
je_buy_salas_reason: "If we want to expand our nation, but we don't want to conquer land through war, another way exists;\nIf we pay enough money, we might be able to bribe the indian chiefs of Nimíipuu, Ídaahę́ and Pannakwati and put their land under our "jurisdiction"."
je_buy_laho: "Siksikaitsitapi's Acquisition"
je_buy_laho_reason: "If we want to expand our nation, but we don't want to conquer land through war, another way exists;\nIf we pay enough money, we might be able to bribe the indian chiefs of Siksikaitsitapi and put their land under our "jurisdiction"."

text_je_buy_sal: "The Sahap-Salish Union has been annexed"
text_je_buy_bla: "Blackfoot has been annexed"
text_noexssh: "The Numic League doesn't exist anymore"
je_sshyua: "Bribing the Numic League Chiefs"
  je_sshyua_reason: "To facilitate the acquisition of land from the Numic League, we could implement a strategic plan involving the distribution of "gifts" to local chiefs as a means of bribery and persuasion.\nWhile this operation is anticipated to be costly and span over three years, the hoped-for outcome of securing land through diplomatic maneuvering could provide significant long-term benefits."
je_sshyua_goal: "The #bold Progress Bar#! has reached #bold 36#!"
je_ye_button_col: "Pass the Budgetary Principles Act"
je_ye_button_col_desc: "Our nation deeply abhors war, but since the European settlers have kept expanding their borders towards our lands, we are forced to a compromise in order not to get surrounded by them."
jeyebutcol: "Passing this act will unlock certain decisions in the future"
je_ye_button_migr: "Write False Propagandistic Articles"
je_ye_button_migr_desc: "We can write deceptive articles on the newspapers we export to the west to create a dreamlike image of our lands.\nWe will lose credibility as a country, but we will also greatly boost the immigration."
je_ye_button_int: "Pass the Integration Act"
je_ye_button_int_desc: "As an atheist country, religions are illegal, but it is no secret that there are still people who practice them in secret.\nThe incoming immigration will bring manpower, but it will also exacerbate this problem; If we want to stay loyal to Yuanpei's beliefs, we must do something to integrate the new immigrants as soon as possible."
je_ye_button_mos: "Pass the "Most Infamous Law""
je_ye_button_mos_desc: "This motion has been harshly criticized in the past, thus why it was never enacted, but now that our nation is in desperate need of manpower, some politicians are considering to discuss it again.\nIf this law was to pass, it would impose a fine on every man over 25 who is not married, and every man over 30 who doesn't have at least two children."
je_yue_laws: "Need of Change"
je_yue_laws_reason: "Yuanpei's Haven was born as a unwarlike haven, and if we want to stay loyal to the Founder's will, we must find alternative ways to secure the independence and the prosperity of our country."
je_yue_dict: "To Ensure Survival"
je_yue_dict_reason: "Yuanpei's Haven is facing the biggest crisis of its history, and the unwillingness of some members of the council to understand that some changes are to be made will be the cause of the demise of our City.\nThe only way to guarantee the survival of Yuanpei's Haven, is to put the right people in power."
je_yue_ass: "The Integration Act"
je_yue_ass_reason: "While previously the penalties for religious acts were not harsh, with the Integration Act the state can search people's houses to find any sort of religious icon, as well as inhibit religious people from entering certain buildings.\nThis will cause some people to become atheist for convenience, but it will also cause massive unrest in the religious population."
je_yua_kor: "The Protection Pact"
je_yua_kor_reason: "If we want to discuss a possible renewal of the pact to keep the status quo, we must send a delegation to Korea, otherwise if we just wait we will become independent;\nbeware of the second option, because independence also means economic independence, and we have to make sure our economy is ready to detach from Korea's market, or we could cause a crisis."
je_ymnyua: "Guardians of the Yuman People"
je_ymnyua_reason: "By offering security and stability, we may gain the trust and loyalty of the [GetCulture('na_yuman').GetName] people.\nIf we successfully demonstrates our capability to protect them, we could pave the way for a peaceful annexation of their land."

je_auth_for_reason: ""
je_cape_fm: "Protect the Cape"

je_cape_fm_two: "World's Restocking Port"
je_cape_fm_two_reason: "Until another way to reach the east is found, every european ship going to and coming from the east has to restock in Cape Colony;\nTaking that region would grant us wealth, as well as political power and influence."
je_suez_fm: "The Suez Canal"
je_suez_fm_reason: "Building a canal that connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea seems like madness, but thanks to the technological developments of this century it has been confirmed that it is indeed possible to build such a canal.\nBuilding it would revolutionize the international trade, so we have to make sure to be the ones to build it and own it."
je_suez_fm_two: "Protect the Suez"
je_suez_fm_two_reason: "The Suez is by far our greatest asset, hence the idea of losing it is not to be contemplated."

je_korea_advance: "Completing this Journal Entry will make "Questioned Authority" JE advance."
je_kor_main: "Questioned Authority"
je_kor_main_reason: "The authority of the heir is being questioned by the parliament, and the country is currently in a military impasse, with the armed forces refusing to obey any order that comes from the Heir.\nThis situation cannot continue, and therefore the Heir must find a way to restore his authority and impose himself as the legitimate ruler of this nation."
je_kor_main_goal: "The heir has re-established his authority"
je_kor_navy: "The Treaty of Pusan"
je_kor_navy_reason: "Ten years ago Korea lost a humiliating war against The Netherlands and had to sign the Treaty of Pusan, in which The Netherlands commited itself to guarantee Korea's economic and military independence from any foreign power, and in exchange Korea could not exert its influence on any east asian nation, and had to renounce to its navy.\nThis treaty is an insult to our nation, and now that The Netherlands is facing a crisis, it's the perfect time to cancel the treaty and rebuild the Royal Navy."
je_kor_autoc: "Centralizing the Power"
je_kor_autoc_reason: "Ever since the establishment of the parliament, the powers of the king and the nobility have been greatly reduced.\nA part of the aristocracy would support the heir if he decided to disband the parliament, and if he was to do it democratically, nobody could complain.\nWithout the parliament, the authority of the heir would become harder to challenge."
je_kor_manc: "The Matter of Manchuria"
je_kor_manc_reason: "The kingdom of Manchuria is a tributary of Korea, but ever since the death of the previous ruler, there have been no official statements from their government regarding our nation, and this diplomatic silence might have a deeper meaning.\nOur country cannot afford to create another crisis at the moment, therefore we can only wait for the Kingdom of Manchuria to clarify their position in relation to Korea."
kor_manc: "The king of Manchuria has recognized Korea as his overlord"
je_kor_rac: "The Royal Police Force"
je_kor_rac_reason: "Establishing a police force under the direct command of the heir would grant him enormous power.\nEven if it cannot be considered a proper army, this new force would be able to suppress any revolt, as well as being a visible demonstration of the influence and power that the heir holds over all the major towns."
je_kor_age: "The Coronation Ceremony"
je_kor_age_reason: "While it would be the norm to wait for the heir to be sixteen years old before holding the coronation ceremony, the exceptional circumstances we find ourselves in allow us to force the law and hold an early ceremony right after the heir's 14th birthday."
kor_cor: "The heir has been crowned (the decision to arrange the ceremony will be available one year before the heir's 14th birthday)"
je_kor_rail: "Solve the Infrastructure Problem"
je_kor_rail_reason: "The quick industrialization of our country has brought us great wealth, but also many infrastructural problems.\nOur roads are not able to satisfy anymore the growing demand of our industrial sector for a better and faster transportation system, and therefore it is a necessity that we make investments for the construction of a nationwide railway system."

je_pb_maint: "The Cost of Influence"
je_pb_maint_reason: "Exerting ones influence has never been an inexpensive affair, and the cost of management of a power block is particularly high.\nThe management of a power block will be a heavy burden on the bureacratic system of our country, and therefore we have to consider if we actually want to mantain such an expensive business.\n\n#bold This Journal Entry is just symbolic, the game checks every month if you have made a [concept_power_bloc] and gives you a modifier accordingly.#!"
je_pb_member: "Bureaucratic Overload"
je_pb_member_reason: "Being a member of a power bloc gives many advantages, but also creates quite a heavy burden on our bureaucratic system.\nWe must think thoroughly about whether to actually be part of a power bloc.\n\n#bold This Journal Entry is just symbolic, the game checks every month if you are a member of a [concept_power_bloc] and gives you a modifier accordingly.#!"
