 je_na_swn_secure_to_michigan: "Secure Our Claim on Indiana"
 je_na_swn_secure_to_michigan_reason: "If we can forcefully restrict land movement from Southern Michigan, we can press a claim on Michigan."
 je_na_swn_secure_the_south: "Secure the South"
 je_na_swn_secure_the_south_reason: "We need to formalize the borders on our southern edge to keep the capital safe."

 je_na_one_secure_to_michigan: "Secure Our Bridge to Southern Michigan"
 je_na_one_secure_to_michigan_reason: "Without this land bridge conjoining us to Southern Michigan, our claim on Michigan will grow weak. We must protect this path."
 je_na_one_secure_the_north: "Secure Wisconsin"
 je_na_one_secure_the_north_reason: "While we control most of the coastline on the south of the Great Lakes, we are missing the space needed to make it prosper. By obtaining all of Wisconsin we can expand more rapidly."
 je_na_one_secure_the_south: "Secure Our Capital"
 je_na_one_secure_the_south_reason: "Our capital is the most important part of our budding nation. We must work to secure it from our neighbors, lest we endanger our people."

 je_buy_luoisiana: "The Louisiana Purchase"
 je_buy_luoisiana_reason: "Louisiana is the denomination given to the lands occupied by the King of France that are located along the Mississippi river and through Atakapan lands.\nWe do not recognize those claims, but at the moment we are far too weak to oppose the French.\nLuckily for us, those territories have little to no immediate value to the crown of France, and for the right price we might be able to purchase them."
 je_buy_louisiana: "Send a letter to the King of France"
 no_loi: "Louisiana doesn't exist or is independent."
 je_buy_louisiana_desc: "We can send a delegation to Baton Rouge to ask the governor of Louisiana to send a letter to the King of France.\nThere is no guarantee the King will accept, but if we were to send the letter in a moment of economic instability for France, he might actually accept the deal."
 luoi_text: "France has not rejected the deal recently\n#bold Warning!#!\nIf you press this button while Louisiana is not a subject of France, no event will trigger for France and you will lose the possibility to press this button for the rest of the game"
